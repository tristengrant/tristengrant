## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tristen Grant. A Canadian picture book illustrator & webcomic creator. Inspired by my own experience with a learning disability, I make art that helps kids feel seen & valued. I also compose ambient music + share open-source tools that support my process.

### I use Github to manage and version control my personal website, [tristengrant.com](https://tristengrant.com/) and my webcomic [Cat and Bot]{https://catandbotcomic.com/}
